== Setting up the environment

Singleshot is developed against Rails Edge.

To get the latest copy use one of the following:

$ svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ode/sandbox/singleshot
$ git svn clone http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ode/sandbox/singleshot
$ git clone git://github.com/Assaf/singleshot.git

To setup you development environment, specifically installing all the necessary
Gems and setting up the development and test databases, run the setup task:

$ rake setup

This will also create a default account using your user name and the password
'secret'

To get started:

$ rake run

Point your browser to http://localhost:3000 and login with your user name and
password.


== Setting up the database

The database is configured in config/databases.yml.  The development and test
database is set to use SQLite3, and the SQLite3 drive is installed when running
rake setup.  For production, you should consider using something else (the
default configuration is MySQL).


== Migrations

Rails migrations are a great way to progress from one database schema version
to another in production.  Each major milestone or release will include a new
set of migrations so production database can be updated by running rake
db:migrate.

Migrations are not used to move from one schema to another during daily
development progress.  The database schema will just change and you'll have to
recreate the entire database.

Those changes are recorded in the form of migration, but to update run:

$ rake db:migrate:reset

This task will recreate the entire development and test database.  In addition,
we uses the annotate-models Gems to, well, annotate the Rails models with the
most recent database schema.  So when changing the database schema, follow
with:

$ rake annotate_models

To recreate the dummy data used for development:

$ rake db:populate


== Getting Involved

The official specification for Singleshot is written using RSpec.  Please use
RSpec to specify the expected behavior and fill it up with test cases, from
which we can build/fix/refactor the implementation.

Documentation goes in the doc/pages directory, uses the Textile markup syntax,
and is considered part of the source code and each official release.  We use
these files to generate the Web site and PDF documentation.

A reference for Textile is available here:
