* Tested with JRuby 1.1.6 using the JRuby MySQL ActiveRecord Adapter.
* Tested with Ruby 1.9 using the 2.8.1 (from source) MySQL driver.
* CSRF (forgery protection) disabled when using HTTP Basic authentication.
This allows the wonders of curl during development, but may pose a security issue.
* Switched to using MySQL instead of SQLite. There are some noticable
differences and developing on the same database we intend to deploy on is just
better.
