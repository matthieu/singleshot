title: Singleshot
---

Singleshot is a task manager. You use it to track and complete your tasks,
processes use it to involve you.  We're building Singleshot because
"Ode":http://ode.apache.org deserves an excellent task manager, but we'll make
it possible to use Singleshot anywhere. That's why we're spending a lot of time
getting the API right (REST, if you have to ask).

The refactoring, with cleaner API, much improved specs, and new UI is happening
"on Github":http://github.com/assaf/singleshot. You can clone it from
git://github.com/assaf/singleshot.git. Once it becomes good enough, will merge
it back into trunk and start working towards a 1.0 release.
