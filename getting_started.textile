Singleshot is developed against Rails 2.3.  Make sure to have Rails 2.3 installed:

<pre>
$ gem update --system
$ gem install rails
</pre>

To get the latest copy use one of the following:

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/intalio/singleshot.git
</pre>

You will need MySQL. The file @config/databases.yml@ contains the connection configurations for the development, test and production environment. You can either setup MySQL accounts and databases based on this file, or change it to pick different database/account.

To setup you development environment, specifically installing all the necessary dependencies and setting up the development and test databases, run the script @script/setup@:

<pre>
$ ruby script/setup
</pre>

This will also create a default account using your user name and the password 'secret'

To get started:

<pre>$ ruby script/server</pre>

Point your browser to "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 and login with your user name and password.
