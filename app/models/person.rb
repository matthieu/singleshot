# Internally we keep a primary key association between the person and various other records.
# Externally, we use a public identifier returned from #to_param and resolved with Person.identify.
# The base implementation uses the person's nickname (derived from e-mail address) as the public identifier.
#
# In addition, we need to know the person's full name for presentation and e-mail address for
# sending notifications.  Language and timezone (in minutes relative to UTC) are optional,
# although it is highly recommended to set the timezone.
#
# Passwords are optional, since not every one requires password authentication (may use OpenID,
# or some other authentication mechanism).  We use BCrype to store passwords securely.
#
# The access_key field is used for authentication when sessions and HTTP Basic are not possible,
# for example, to access feeds and iCal.
