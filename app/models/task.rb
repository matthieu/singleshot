  # --- Task status ---

  # A task can report one of these statuses:
  # * reserved  -- Task exists but is not yet ready or active.
  # * ready     -- Task is ready and can be claimed by owner.
  # * active    -- Task is performed by its owner.
  # * suspended -- Task is suspended.
  # * completed -- Task has completed.
  # * cancelled -- Task was cancelled.
  
  # A task can start as reserved and remain there until populated with enough
  # information to transition to ready.  From ready, a stakeholder can claim
  # the task, transitioning it to active.  The task transitions back to ready
  # if stakeholder releases that claim.
  #
  # Task can transition from ready/active to suspended and back.  Task can
  # transition to completed only from active, and transition to cancelled from
  # any other state but completed.  Completed and cancelled are terminal
  # states.
