        <p>Singleshot is a task manager. You use it to track and complete your tasks,<br />
processes use it to involve you.  We&#8217;re building Singleshot because<br />
<a href="http://ode.apache.org">Ode</a> deserves an excellent task manager, but we&#8217;ll make<br />
it possible to use Singleshot anywhere. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re spending a lot of time<br />
getting the <span class="caps">API</span> right (<span class="caps">REST</span>, if you have to ask).</p>
<p>The refactoring, with cleaner <span class="caps">API</span>, much improved specs, and new UI is happening<br />
<a href="http://github.com/assaf/singleshot">on Github</a>. You can clone it from<br />
git://github.com/assaf/singleshot.git. Once it becomes good enough, will merge<br />
it back into trunk and start working towards a 1.0 release.</p>
